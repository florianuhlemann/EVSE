EVSE

## Introduction
> This collection of library shall enable the development of an EVSE based on an STM32F0 microcontroller. It is the software for the CircuitMaker project linked above.

## controlpilot_stm32
> This library configures and enables the interface main interface for handling the EVSE logic with the vehicle.

## encoder_stm32
> This library configures and enables the interface for a possible rotary encoder to be used as the user interface.

## flash_stm32
> This library configures and enables the interface for storing data between reboot.

## font8x8_basic
> This library represents a selection of font glyphs that are used with the OLED display.

## helper_stm32
> This library provides a selection of functions that configure the STM32F0 and bridge multiple libaries.

## oled_stm32_ssd1306
> This library configures and enables the interface for SPI to an SSD1306-based OLED display.

## usart_stm32_console
> This library configures and enables the interface for USART to an FTDI chip for debug information.

## userbutton_stm32
> This library configures and enables the interface for a selection of buttons to be used as the user interface.

## ws2812_led
> This library configures and enables the interface for a 1-wire signal to control a WS2812B-based LED array.
